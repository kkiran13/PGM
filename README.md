Bayesian and Markov network construction to find dependency between features in Children's handwritten data set

Performed Data Cleansing, Mean, entropy calculations, applied Pearson's Chi Square test on the data to find dependency matrix between features,
applied log-loss approach on the top dependent pairs to obtain directionality of dependency.
